Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Slice the eggplants into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Brush both sides of the eggplant slices with vegetable oil. Season with salt and pepper. Grill or saut\u00e9 the eggplant slices until they're tender and lightly browned. Set aside.\n\n2. In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until it's browned, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks. Drain the excess fat from the skillet. Add the chopped onions and crushed garlic to the skillet and cook until the onions are translucent. Stir in the tomato sauce, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for a few minutes until heated through.\n\n3. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk to make a roux, cooking for 1 minute. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until it thickens, stirring occasionally. Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the Parmesan cheese until melted.\n\n4. In a large bowl, beat the egg. Add the cooked eggplant slices to the bowl and toss them with the beaten egg until they're evenly coated.\n\n5. In a 9x13-inch baking dish, create a layer of the meat sauce. Arrange a layer of the eggplant slices on top of the sauce. Spoon some of the cheese sauce over the eggplant layer. Repeat this process until all the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of cheese sauce on top.\n\n6. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned and the casserole is hot and bubbly.\n\n7. Remove the casserole from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!",
